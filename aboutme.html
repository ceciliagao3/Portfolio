<p>My name is Cecilia, but most know me as Ceci.  I am an incoming junior in high school.</p>
<h2> What I Do </h2>
      <h3> Music</h3>
<p>  For the past 7 years, I have played flute. I am involved in numerous bands, orchestras, and chamber groups
      both inside and outside of school. I also play solo repertoire. Though my musical foundation started with piano, I later chose
      to advance my studies through flute.</p>
      <h3>JSA</h3>
<p> A major portion of my life involves civic engagement and political activism through an organization called the Junior State of America. 
  JSA, the largest student-run organization in the U.S., gives me and hundreds of other high schoolers the chance to debate current issues,
   become involved with local politics, and grow into America's future leaders. My role in helping this organization is through the Cabinet
  of the Midwest state of JSA. Within the various departments on Midwest Cabinet, I have spent the most time in the Debate Department,
  ensuring that debate quality at JSA conventions and events is current, will keep students engaged, and at its best. JSA has had an inextricable
      effect on my individuality.</p>
