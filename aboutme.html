<h1 style="color:#51c1ba;">About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family:trebuchet;">My name is Cecilia, but most know me as Ceci.  I am an incoming junior in hich school.
  For the past 7 years, I have played flute. I am involved in numerous bands, orchestras, and chamber groups
  both inside and outside of school. I also play solo repertoire.
  A major portion of my life involves civic engagement and political activism through an organization called the Junior State of America. 
  JSA, the largest student-run organization in the U.S., gives me and hundreds of other high schoolers the chance to debate current issues,
   become involved with local politics, and grow into America's future leaders. My role in helping this organization is through the Cabinet
  of the Midwest state of JSA.</p>
<p>These are my Likes and Dislikes:<br>My likes include classic novels, brussels sprouts, and operas.
  <br>My dislikes include 10-lb. AP Biology textbooks, country music (with a burning passion), and excessively chocolatey 
  desserts.</p>
<p> Here's a fun fact about me!<br> My go-to drink is kombucha, which is an effervescent tea.
