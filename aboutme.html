<h1 style="color:#9ddadb;">About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family:trebuchet;">My name is Cecilia.  I am an incoming junior in hich school.
  For the past 7 years, I have played the flute. I am involved in numerous bands, orchestras, and chamber groups
  both inside and outside of school. I also play solo repertoire.
  A major portion of my life involves civic engagement and political activism through an organization called the Junior State of America. 
  JSA, the largest student-run organization in the U.S., gives me and hundreds of other high schoolers the chance to debate current issues,
   become involved with local politics, and grow into America's future leaders. </p>
